Burger Restaurant Simulation made for CPE 360 Data Structures and Algorithms. Simulates a restaurant using queues and kept track of statistics
such as queue length, queue wait time, etc.

I wrote this code over 2 years ago, and still have issues with properly recording the statistics. If you see where the issues occured, let me know
how to fix it.
